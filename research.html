        <h3>Human Aware Robotic Exploration</h3>
        <br>
        <p>For the past year, I've investigated human robot interaction, specifically I worked on a simulation experiment to allow for a data driven pipeline for cognitive state estimation</p>
        <p>I am currently working to expand on this by folding trust modeling into our pipeline, as well as investigated how autonomous team members can leverage this state information</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a first year computer science master's student, currently researching human robot teamming. 
            I have a broad background in CS with strong interests in Machine Learning, Distributed Systems / Parallel Computing, and Human Computer Interaction</p>

        <h2>Human Aware Robotic Exploration</h2>
        <p>For the past year, I've investigated human robot interaction, specifically I worked on a simulation experiment to allow for a data driven pipeline for cognitive state estimation. I am currently working to expand on this by folding trust modeling into our pipeline, as well as investigating how autonomous team members can leverage this state information</p>
